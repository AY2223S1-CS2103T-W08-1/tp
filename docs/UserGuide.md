* The command words are ``findpatient`` or ``fp``.
* The prefixes are n/ for Name, p/ for Phone, e/ for Email, a/ for Address, r/ for Remark and t/ for Tags.
* The filter is case-insensitive. e.g. han will match Han
* Can filter using full words or partial words. e.g. han will match Hannah
* Can filter using a combination of inputs for a field, according to the constraints of the field. 
  e.g. e/@gmail.com
* Can filter using one field or multiple fields at once, but only tag prefix can be used more than once in a single command. 
  e.g. n/John p/91234567 t/friend t/colleague
* If there are no prefixes keyed in, an error message will be shown with the correct command format.
* If the input after a prefix is empty(except for remark)/invalid, an error message with the constraint of the field will be shown.

Examples:
* ```findpatient n/ale``` returns ``Alex Yeoh`` and ``alex tan``.
