## 1.4 Finding

### 1.4.1 Finding patients `findpatient` `fp`

Filters patients by one or more fields using their prefixes, and their corresponding inputs (numbers, letters,
special characters).

Format:
```findpatient <prefix><input> ...``` or ```fp <prefix><input>...```

* The command words are ``findpatient`` or ``fp``.
* The prefixes are n/ for Name, p/ for Phone, e/ for Email, a/ for Address, r/ for Remark and t/ for Tags.
* The filter is case-insensitive. e.g. han will match Han
* Can filter using full words or partial words. e.g. han will match Hannah
* Can filter using a combination of inputs for a field, according to the constraints of the field.
  e.g. e/@gmail.com
* Can filter using one field or multiple fields at once. e.g. n/John p/91234567
* If there are no prefixes keyed in, an error message will be shown with the correct command format.
* If the input after a prefix is empty/invalid, an error message with the constraint of the field will be shown.

Examples:
* ```findpatient n/ale``` returns ``Alex Yeoh`` and ``alex tan``.
